### Henlo 👋

I'm [@artnoi](https://twitter.com/artnoi). Read my blog on [artnoi.com](https://artnoi.com). I currently work at [Cleverse](https://cleverse.com) as a software engineer, developing its dApp projects.

> 🎓 I went to a business school, majoring in finance, but decided to get a job in tech.

**My language of choice is Go, though I also intend to learn Rust.**

I love these 2 languages because their design and trade-offs seem *right* (for a noob dev), although the first language I "tried" to learn was Swift.

### Personal projects me and my friends find useful

- 💰 [FnGoBot](https://github.com/artnoi43/fngobot) - a Telegram chat bot for tracking/alerting prices from financial markets.

- 🔒 [gfc](https://github.com/artnoi43/gfc) - my first Go code! This CLI program is used to encrypt/decrypt with AES256 or RSA.

### Small useful programs for devs

- 💻 [rd.js](https://gitlab.com/artnoi/unix/-/blob/main/utils/bin/rd.js) - a CLI JavaScipt snippet that use macOS Disk Utility.app (`diskutil`) to create a ramdisk.

- #️⃣ [csc](https://github.com/artnoi43/csc) - a simple CLI tool to generate checksum, with optional comparison.

- 🔤 [cases](https://github.com/artnoi43/cases) a simple CLI tool that just prints the uppercased/lowercased versions of CLI argument

Apart from a "program", there's also a [collection of shell scripts](https://gitlab.com/artnoi/unix). These scripts were the first code I wrote.
